# Build a Product Landing Page

**Objective:** Build a page that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL.

- A page should have at least one **media query**.
- A page should utilize **CSS flexbox** at least once.

## Summary

üìù The project was done in the CodePen environment, so I **transfered it to GitHub** and **made some improvements**:

- Made better **commenting** and **code readability**.
- Created **favicon**.
- Recreated header bottom image for **high resolution screens**.
- Deleted repetitive and unnecessary CCS code lines and so **simplified the code**.
