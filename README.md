# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Project

# Build a Product Landing Page

**Objective:** Build a page that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL.

**Live preview** of my page is [here](https://ha-mundo.github.io/FCC-Landing-Page/).

**Source of the project** can be found in [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://start-landing-page.netlify.app/).

## Requirements

- Clicked navigation buttons must **take to the corresponding section** of the landing page.
- In the page is a product **video**.
- In the page is a **form element** with an **input of required email** and a **submit button**.
- The navigation bar should **always be at the top of the viewport**.
- A page should have at least one **media query**.
- A page should utilize **CSS flexbox** at least once.

## Summary

üìù The project was done in the CodePen environment, so I **transfered it to GitHub** and **made some improvements**:

- Made better **commenting** and **code readability**.
- Created **favicon**.
- Recreated header bottom image for **high resolution screens**.
- Deleted repetitive and unnecessary CCS code lines and so **simplified the code**.
